        "Instead of running an EKF in a Euclidean chart (where you must pick coordinates and retractions), the **IEKF** keeps the state on the group $G$ (e.g., $SO(3), SE(3)$) and defines the estimation error **invariantly** using group operations. Then one propagates the state with the group exponential, put process noise in the Lie algebra, and linearize the **error dynamics** (not the state) so that the linearized model depends only on inputs—not on the current estimate. This yields better consistency, especially under large rotations or fast motion.\n",

        "Each agent represents a fully actuated rigid body — such as a quadrotor or spacecraft — with six degrees of freedom and independent local dynamics, control, and communication interfaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "The platform will enable:\n",
        "- **Realistic multibody dynamics**, using accurate physics rather than kinematic approximations.  \n",
        "- **Scalable simulations** with tens or hundreds of agents running in parallel.  \n",
        "- **Decentralized control architectures**, where each agent executes its own control law and exchanges information only with neighboring agents.  \n",
        "- **Configurable communication topologies**, supporting fixed, random, or time-varying network graphs.  \n",
        "- **Distributed synchronization and consensus experiments**, under realistic conditions including link dropouts, delays, and asynchronous updates.\n",

        "- **Native SE(3) multibody dynamics**, handled via the `MultibodyPlant` framework.  \n",
        "- **Accurate inertial, constraint, and contact modeling**, suitable for aerial and space robots.  \n",

        "- **Symbolic and differentiable mechanics**, useful for verifying Lyapunov-based stability and control laws.  \n",
        "- **Python and C++ APIs**, making it ideal for coupling with high-level multi-agent orchestration.\n",

        "The proposed system will **extend Drake** by developing an upper-layer framework that manages:\n",
        "1. **Agent objects:** each encapsulating a local instance of Drake's `MultibodyPlant`, controller logic, and state observer.  \n",
        "2. **Communication network:** a distributed message-passing system using `networkx` and `asyncio` or `mpi4py` to simulate realistic topologies and delays.  \n",
        "3. **Global orchestrator:** a parallel simulation manager coordinating agents' time steps and interactions.  For example using `LangGraph`\n",
        "4. **Visualization tools:** live rendering via Drake's `MeshCat` and additional 3D plotting of communication graphs, trajectories, and formation metrics.\n",

Specifically, we will **cross-validate our Bayesian findings against the paper’s baselines** on the questions it actually studied: (i) **drivers of low productivity**—we'll compare our posterior effect sizes and interaction terms (e.g., incentive, WIP, workers, and incentive × WIP) with the paper’s rule-based importance and thresholds (notably the ~69.5 BDT incentive split); (ii) **classification performance**—for both **3-class** (low/moderate/normal) and **2-class** (low vs. not-low) formulations, we will report accuracy/AUC on the paper’s split and benchmark against its top models (tree ensemble; GBT + SMOTE); (iii) **actionable thresholds**—we’ll check whether our Bayesian “what-if” and monotone/spline estimates imply breakpoints consistent with the paper’s rules; and (iv) **class-imbalance handling**—while Bayes won’t use SMOTE, we will compare our calibrated probability outputs and cost-sensitive results to the paper’s oversampled 2-class scores to assess whether we match or improve their detection of “low” days.

        "\n",
        "This project aims to create an AI-assisted, simulation-driven framework for intelligent building HVAC, modeling, control and characterization. First, we will build a multi-zone HVAC modeling and simulation platform on top of EnergyPlus. This platform will support natural-language interaction for configuring buildings, HVAC systems, and schedules, and provide a user-friendly interface for visualizing simulation outputs (temperature, humidity, $CO_2$, loads, flows, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "Using that platform, we will develop an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)–based online parameter estimation method to identify key unknown building/zone parameters in real time. The target parameters include: (i) effective sensible thermal capacitance, (ii) overall heat transfer conductance to ambient, (iii) zone occupancy, and (iv) infiltration / outdoor air mass flow rates. We will verify the EKF estimator entirely in simulation by injecting known “ground truth” parameters into EnergyPlus and checking recovery accuracy and convergence.\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the EKF, we will explore alternative adaptive/learning strategies for online estimation of the same parameters (for example, recursive least squares variants or data-driven/ML estimators), and compare their performance and robustness.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, we will experimentally validate the estimator on a controlled laboratory-scale single-zone HVAC test rig. The goal is to demonstrate that the identified parameters track real physical behavior and can serve as a foundation for future decentralized multizone HVAC control and optimization.\n",

        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "This project uses the **Industrial Safety & Health Analytics Database** (accident logs from 12 plants across 3 countries; each row = one incident) to generate practical, evidence-based safety insights. We will build an explainable analytics + **Bayesian** pipeline focused on severity drivers, near-miss patterns, **Tier-3 text classification**, and a **domain Knowledge Graph (KG)** that grounds predictions in a structured safety ontology for richer queries, reasoning, and explainability. Bayesian components include hierarchical (partial-pooling) ordinal models for severity, **a parallel Bayesian classifier on sentence embeddings for calibrated uncertainty**, and decision-focused posterior risk scoring. The **KG** captures entities like Task, Equipment, Hazard, and Control, and links them to each incident for search, analytics, and constraint checks. ([Kaggle][1]). The developed methods will be validated against at least one other similar dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Core Questions\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Drivers of severity:** Which factors most strongly predict higher `Accident Level (I–VI)`? (Explainable ordinal/multiclass models, SHAP + KG features).\n",
        "2. **Near-miss hotspots:** Where is `Potential Accident Level` ≫ actual, and which **Task–Hazard–Control** motifs dominate those gaps (via KG subgraphs)?\n",
        "3. **Auto-tagging risk from text (Tier-3 + KG):** Can `Description` accurately predict `Critical Risk`/severity using a fine-tuned transformer plus a Bayesian companion — **and** ground those labels to KG nodes for auditable, queryable context?\n",
        "4. **Role/party disparities:** How do risks and severities differ for employees vs. third-party workers and across sectors/plants (with KG-derived features and motifs)?\n",
        "5. **When risk spikes:** What time patterns (hour/weekday/month) correlate with higher counts and severity; which KG motifs are over-represented in those windows?\n",
        "\n",
        "## Data & Features\n",
        "\n",
        "* Source: Kaggle “Industrial Safety & Health Analytics Database” (IHM Stefanini). Columns include date/time, sector, country (anonymized), `Accident Level`, `Potential Accident Level`, `Critical Risk`, `Employee/Third-Party`, narrative `Description`, etc. ([Kaggle][1])\n",
        "* Feature sets:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Tabular:** one-hot sector/risk/party; temporal (hour/weekday/month).\n",
        "  * **Text:** transformer tokenization of `Description` for fine-tuning; parallel **sentence embeddings** (e.g., MiniLM) reduced (PCA 50–200 dims) for the Bayesian classifier.\n",
        "  * **KG-derived:** indicators of extracted **Task/Equipment/Hazard/Control**; motif counts (e.g., `working at height ∧ missing harness`), node centralities, and link-prediction scores.\n",
        "  * **Fusion:** concatenate KG-derived features with text embeddings/tabular for downstream models.\n",
        "  * For exploratory context, see a community EDA example. ([Kaggle][2])\n",
        "\n",
        "## Methods (brief)\n",
        "\n",
        "* **EDA & balancing:** stratified summaries; handle class imbalance (class weights / focal loss for DL; class weights for Bayesian/logistic).\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Bayesian modeling (severity):**\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Ordinal severity (I–VI):** cumulative probit/logit with **hierarchical (plant/sector) random effects** for partial pooling.\n",
        "  * **Decision layer:** pick alert thresholds via **expected utility** using posterior predictive draws.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Text classification:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. **Fine-tuned transformer (primary):** DistilBERT/BERT fine-tuned for `Critical Risk` (and/or severity) with class weights/focal loss; calibrate (temperature or isotonic).\n",
        "  2. **Bayesian companion (calibration & uncertainty):** Bayesian logistic/ordinal on MiniLM embeddings ± selected tabular/KG features with a **regularized horseshoe** prior; use posterior draws for credible intervals and disagreement checks.\n",
        "  3. **Active learning (HIL):** query by uncertainty **and** model disagreement; newly confirmed labels also update **KG nodes/edges** (closing the loop).\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Knowledge Graph:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Ontology (starter):** `Incident`, `Plant`, `Sector`, `Actor`, `Task`, `Equipment`, `Location`, `Hazard`, `CriticalRisk`, `Control`, `InjuryType`, `SeverityLevel`.\n",
        "  * **Extraction:** rules + NER/RE (spaCy/transformer) from `Description` to populate `involves(Task/Equipment/Hazard/Control)`, `hasCriticalRisk`, `resultedIn(Severity)`.\n",
        "  * **Entity linking & normalization:** synonym tables (e.g., “forklift” ≈ “lift truck”); map model outputs to canonical KG nodes.\n",
        "  * **Reasoning & QA:** run **constraint checks** (e.g., SHACL-like rules: `working at height` should mention `harness/guardrail`), surface **missing controls**, and produce **motif analytics** (Task–Hazard–Control triads).\n",
        "  * **Features to ML:** KG motifs, degree/centrality, and rule-violation flags feed the transformer head (via adapters) and the Bayesian model (as covariates).\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Explainability:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Transformer:** salient phrases (Integrated Gradients) + KG grounding (“why” links to Hazard/Control nodes).\n",
        "  * **Bayesian:** posterior effect sizes for KG features/embeddings; show credible intervals.\n",
        "  * **KG views:** incident cards with extracted entities, relations, provenance spans, and confidence.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Validation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Text tasks: **macro-F1**, class-wise F1, **ECE** calibration, PR curves for rare classes.\n",
        "  * Ordinal severity: MAE (ordinal), C-index, calibration.\n",
        "  * KG extraction: precision/recall on a labeled subset; **rule-violation detection rate** and downstream lift when adding KG features.\n",
        "  * Robustness: temporal split to check drift; KG-motif drift over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Deliverables\n",
        "\n",
        "* Reproducible notebooks: cleaning, EDA, **Tier-3 text classification**, Bayesian severity model, KG extraction/ingest, and explainability.\n",
        "* A **running KG** (Neo4j or RDF store) with ontology, ETL scripts, synonym tables, and provenance.\n",
        "* Interactive dashboards: incident/severity trends, near-miss gap heatmaps, **uncertainty-aware predictions**, and **KG motif explorer** (Task–Hazard–Control patterns, missing controls).\n",
        "* A short memo with actionable recommendations and **calibrated risk** bands; KG-grounded checklists (e.g., “Top hazards lacking controls”).\n",
